class Choices(object):
    """
    A class to encapsulate handy functionality for lists of choices
    for a Django model field.

    Each argument to ``Choices`` is a choice, represented as either a
    string, a two-tuple, or a three-tuple.

    If a single string is provided, that string is used as the
    database representation of the choice as well as the
    human-readable presentation.

    If a two-tuple is provided, the first item is used as the database
    representation and the second the human-readable presentation.

    If a triple is provided, the first item is the database
    representation, the second a valid Python identifier that can be
    used as a readable label in code, and the third the human-readable
    presentation. This is most useful when the database representation
    must sacrifice readability for some reason: to achieve a specific
    ordering, to use an integer rather than a character field, etc.

    Regardless of what representation of each choice is originally
    given, when iterated over or indexed into, a ``Choices`` object
    behaves as the standard Django choices list of two-tuples.

    If the triple form is used, the Python identifier names can be
    accessed as attributes on the ``Choices`` object, returning the
    database representation. (If the single or two-tuple forms are
    used and the database representation happens to be a valid Python
    identifier, the database representation itself is available as an
    attribute on the ``Choices`` object, returning itself.)
